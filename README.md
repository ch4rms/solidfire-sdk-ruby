# Solidfire
This is the solidfire gem. Feel free to use it to your heart's content, but be aware that this gem is in the develop phase. Any version you use will be a beta version until the gem is officially released. As such, it may have latent bugs. Feel free to contact Ariel Hoffman for help and bugfixes at ariel.hoffman@netapp.com.

## Installation
You'll have to install the gemfile from source.

1. Clone this project onto your machine.
2. Set up your RVM or version of Ruby. RVM stands for ruby version manager. It is very helpful for troubleshooting. For more info about RVMs, see https://rvm.io/. 
3. Execute the following commands:

```ruby
gem build solidfire.gemspec
gem install solidfire-0.1.0.gem
```
Now the gem should be installed on your version of Ruby!
